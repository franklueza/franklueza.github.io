            <h2>A model of Laura and Petrarch</h2>
            <p>A model of Laura and Petrarch. The emotions of Laura and Petrarch are
                now modeled by means of three ordinary differential equations. Laura is described by
                a single variable L(t), representing her love for the poet at time t. Positive and high
                values of L mean warm friendship, while negative values should be associated with
                coldness and antagonism. The personality of Petrarch is more complex; its description
                requires two variables: P(t), love for Laura, and Z(t), poetic inspiration. High values
                of P indicate ecstatic love, while negative values stand for despair.</p>
            <p>The model is the following:</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/Model-Laura-and-Petrarch.PNG" alt="Model Laura and Petrach">
            </div>
            <p>where R<sub>L</sub>(.) and R<sub>P</sub>(.) are reaction functions specified below, A<sub>P</sub> [A<sub>L</sub>] is the appeal
                (physical, as well as social and intellectual) of Petrarch [Laura], and all greek letters  are positive constant parameters 
                (this means that variations in the personalities of
                Laura and Petrarch due to aging or other external factors are not considered).</p>
            <p>The rate of change of the love of Laura (eq. (1)) is the sum of three terms.
                The first, negative for positive L, describes the <em>forgetting process</em> characterizing individual. 
                The second, namely R<sub>L</sub> (P), is the reaction of Laura to the love of Petrarch,
                while the third is her response to his appeal. Equation (2) is similar to (1) with one
                relevant exception: the response of Petrarch to the appeal of Laura depends also upon
                his inspiration Z. This takes into account the well-established fact that high moral
                tensions, like those associated with artistic inspiration, attenuate the role of the most
                basic instincts. And there is no doubt that the tensions between Petrarch and Laura
                are of a passionate nature. For example, in sestina XXII, he says</p>
            <blockquote>
                Con lei foss'io da che si parte il sole, <br>
                et non ci vedess' altri che le stelle, <br>
                sol una- nocte, et mai non fosse l'alba; <br>
                [Would I were with her when first sets the sun, <br>
                and no one else could see us but the stars, <br>
                one night alone, and it were never dawn;]
            </blockquote>
            <p>while in his Posteritati he confesses (in Latin): "Libidem me prorsus expertem dicere
                posse optarem quidem, sed si dicat mentiar" [I would truly like to say absolutely
                that I was without libidinousness, but if I said so I would be lying]. Finally, (3)
                simply says that the love of Petrarch sustains his inspiration which, otherwise, would
                exponentially decay with a time constant 1/&alpha;<sub>3</sub>. In other words, poetic inspiration is
                an exponentially weighted integral of the passion of the poet for his mistress.</p>
            <p>The two reaction functions R<sub>L</sub>(P) and R<sub>P</sub>(L) must now be specified. Since most
                individuals love to be loved and hate to be hated, the most simplistic choice (see [1])
                would be to assume that the reaction functions are linear. The linearity of R<sub>P</sub>(L)
                is undoubtedly acceptable (at least for L < 0) since in his poems the poet has very
                intense reactions to the most relevant signs of antagonism from Laura. Thus, we
                assume</p>
            <img src="assets/images/eq-4.PNG" alt="Equation 4">
            <p> It is to be noted that the use of the proportionality coefficient 32, already employed
                in (2) to specify the response of Petrarch to the appeal of Laura, is always possible
                by measuring AL in suitable units.</p>
            <p> On the other hand, a linear reaction function is not appropriate for Laura. In
                fact, only close to the origin can RL(P) be assumed to be linear, thus interpreting the
                natural inclination of a beautiful high-society lady to stimulate harmless flirtations.
                But Laura never goes too far beyond gestures of pure courtesy: she smiles and glances.
                However, when Petrarch becomes more demanding and puts pressure on her, even
                indirectly when his poems are sung in public, she reacts very promptly and rebuffs
                him, as described explicitly in a number of poems, like sonnet XXI:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Mille fiate, o dolce mia guerrera, <br>
                per aver co' begli occhi vostri pace <br>
                v' aggio proferto il cor; ma voi non piace <br>
                mirar si basso colla mente altera. <br>
                [A thousand times, o my sweet enemy, <br>
                to come to terms with your enchanting eyes <br>
                I've offered you my heart, yet you despise <br>
                aiming so low with mind both proud and free.]
            </blockquote>
            <p> This suggests the use of a reaction function R<sub>L</sub>(P) which, for P > 0, first increases
                and then decreases. But the behavior of Laura is also nonlinear for negative values
                of P. In fact, when P << 0, i.e., when the poet despairs, Laura feels very sorry for
                him. Following her genuine Catholic ethic she arrives at the point of overcoming
                her antagonism by strong feelings of pity, thus reversing her reaction to the passion
                of the poet. This behavioral characteristic of Laura is repeatedly described in the
                Canzoniere. For example, in sonnet LXIII the poet says
               </p>
            <blockquote>
                Volgendo gli occhi al mio novo colore <br>
                che fa di morte rimembrar la gente, <br>
                pieta vi mosse; onde, benignamente <br>
                salutando, teneste in vita il core. <br>
                [Casting your eyes upon my pallor new, <br>
                which thoughts of death recalls to all mankind, <br>
                pity in you I've stirred; whence, by your kind <br>
                greetings, my heart to life's kept true.]
            </blockquote>
            <p>The above is equivalent to saying that the function R<sub>L</sub>(P), besides having a positive
                maximum for P > 0, has a negative minimum for P < 0.</p>
            <p>In the following, Laura's reaction function RL(P) is assumed to be a cubic function, i.e.,</p>
            <img src="assets/images/Eq-5.PNG" alt="Equation 5">
            <p> where &beta;<sub>1</sub> in this equation is justified  as &beta;<sub>2</sub> in (4). Thus, for P = &upsih; flattery compensastes
                for antagonism (so that R<sub>L</sub> (&upsih;) = 0), while for P = -&upsih; antagonism is compensated
                for by pity. Moreover, the value of P for which the reaction is maximum [minimum]
                is &upsih;/&#8730;3 [-,&upsih;/&#8730;3]. Obviously, in no way can one support, from the <em>Canzoniere</em> and its
                related historical information, the specific choice (5) for Laura's reaction function. It
                is better to confess that this choice is due to convenience, since it allows one to derive
                analytically a number of interesting results. Nevertheless, these results are robust, in
                the sense that they also hold for other reaction functions, obtained from (5) through
                reasonable perturbations. This point will be discussed later.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, if one takes into account (4), (5), the Laura and Petrarch model
                (1)-(3) becomes</p>
            <img src="assets/images/eq 1-3.PNG" alt="MLaura and Petrarch model (1)-(3)">
            <p>This is the model to be discussed in what follows. It is important to notice that
                this model encapsulates the personalities of Laura and Petrarch as they emerge from
                all the poems of the Canzonriere, and not from the particular 23 poems analyzed by Jones. Thus, the model and the conclusions one can draw from it are "independent"
                from those (see Fig. 1) obtained empirically by Jones.
