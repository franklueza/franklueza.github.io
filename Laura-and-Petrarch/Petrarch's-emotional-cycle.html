            <h2>Petrarch's emotional cycle</h2>
            <p>Francis Petrarch (1304-1374), arguably the
                most lovesick poet of all time, is the author of the Canzoniere, a collection of 366
                poems (sonnets, songs, sestinas, ballads, and madrigals). In Avignon, at the age of
                23, he met Laura, a beautiful but married lady. He immediately fell in love with her
                and, although his love was not reciprocated, he addressed more than 200 poems to
                her over the next 21 years. The poems express bouts of ardor and despair, snubs
                and reconciliations, and they mark the birth of modern love poetry. The verse has
                influenced countless poets, including Shakespeare.</p>
            <p> Unfortunately, only a few lyrics of the Canzoniere are dated; the rest are collected
                in a bafflingly obscure order. The knowledge of the correct chronological order of
                the poems is a prerequisite for studying the lyrical, psychological, and stylistical
                development of any poet. This fact is particularly relevant for Petrarch, who somehow
                represents or, at least, interprets the spectacular transition from the Middle Ages to
                Humanism. For this reason, the identification of the chronological order of the poems
                of the Canzoniere has been for centuries a problem of major concern for scholars.
                Frederic Jones has described in his recent book how he has solved the ordering
                problem. First, he has noticed that in a number of lyrics Petrarch makes reference
                to the recurrent nature of his amorous experience. For example, in sonnet LXXVI
                he says (here and in the following quotations the English version is taken from a
                forthcoming English translation of the Canzoniere by Frederic Jones)</p>
            <blockquote>
                Amor con sue promesse lunsingando<br>
                mi ricondusse alla prigione antica<br>
                [Love's promises so softly flattering me<br>
                have led me back to my old prison's thrall]
            </blockquote>
            <p>while in sonnet CCXXI he asks</p>
            <blockquote>
                Quale mio destin, qual forza o qual inganno<br>
                mi riconduce disarmato al campo<br>
                la 've sempre son vinto?<br>
                [What fate, what power or what insidiousness<br>
                still guides me back, disarmed, to that same field<br>
                wherein I'm always crushed?]
            </blockquote>
            <p>Also Laura's attitude is reported to have recurrently softened. For example, in ballad
                CXLIX Petrarch says</p>
            <blockquote>
                Di tempo in tempo mi si fa men dura<br>
                l'angelica figura e'l dolce riso,<br>
                et l'aria del bel viso<br>
                e degli occhi leggiadri meno oscura<br>
                [From time to time less reproachful seem to me<br>
                her heavenly figure, and her charming face,<br>
                and sweet smile's airy grace,<br>
                while her dancing eyes grow far less dark I see]
            </blockquote>
            <p>Second, Jones has collected all dated poems written when Laura was alive. These
                amount to 42, but only 23 have a fairly secure date. The first (sonnet X) was written
                in 1330 and the last (sonnet CCXII) in 1347. Then, Jones has thoroughly analyzed
                each of these 23 poems from a linguistic and lyrical point of view. On the basis of this
                analysis (described in detail in the third chapter of his book) he has assigned a grade
                ranging from -1 to +1 to each poem. The maximum grade (+1) stands for ecstatic
                love, while very negative grades correspond to deep despair, as in sonnet LXXIX,
                where Petrarch says</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Cosi mancando vo di giorno in giorno,<br>
                    si chiusamente, ch'i' sol me ne accorgo <br>
                    et quella che guardando il cor mi strugge. <br>
                    [Therefore my strength is ebbing day by day, <br>
                    which I alone can secretly survey,<br>
                    and she whose very glance will scourge my heart.]
                </blockquote>
                <p>Intermediate grades indicate less extreme feelings like ardor, serene love, friendship,
                    melancholy, and anguish. For example, sonnet CLXXVI, where Petrarch says</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Parme d'udirla, udendo i rami et l'ore <br>
                    et le frondi, et gli augei lagnarsi, et l'acque <br>
                    mormorando fuggir per l'erba verde. <br>
                    [Her I seem to hear, hearing bough and wind's caress,<br>
                    as birds and leaves lament, as murmuring flees <br>
                    the streamlet coursing through the grasses green.]
                </blockquote>
                <p> is graded -0.45 (corresponding to melancholy).</p>
                <p>The dates and the grades of the 23 poems are reported as points in Fig. 1 (ex-
                    tracted from [4]), together with four rising segments of a dotted line interpolating some
                    of the points. The distances between pairs of nearby segments are not very different,
                    so that one is naturally brought to imagine that these segments are "fragments" of a
                    cyclical pattern. In other words, the analysis indicates that Petrarch's emotions have
                    varied almost periodically over time and that the period of this emotional cycle is
                    slightly less than four years.</p>
                <p>This discovery has been fully exploited by Jones. Indeed, he has extrapolated with
                    a naive technique the segments of Fig. 1, thus deriving an almost cyclical graph E(t)
                    describing the time pattern of Petrarch's emotions during the entire interval concerned
                    [1330, 1348]. Then, he has given a grade E to each undated poem and derived a set
                    {t<sub>i</sub>} of potential dates for each sonnet by setting E(t<sub>i</sub>) = E. Finally, using historical and other information about Petrarch's life and his visits from Avignon to Italy, he
                    has eliminated all but one potential date for each poem, thus solving the ordering problem completely.

                </div>
                <p> The key point of the study is undoubtedly the discovery of Petrarch's emotional
                    cycle. But, in a sense this discovery is only a conjecture supported by relatively weak
                    arguments. Indeed, it is based on noisy data, because each point of Fig. 1 is affected
                    by a horizontal error due to the uncertainty of the date of the poem, and by a vertical
                    error due to Jones's subjective evaluation of the poet's emotional states. Independent
                    arguments supporting the same conjecture, like those given in this paper, are therefore
                    important for reinforcing the conjecture.
