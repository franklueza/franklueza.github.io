            <h2>The L-P cycle</h2>
            <p>In principle, model (6)-(8) describes the dynamics of the
                emotions evolving between any poet and his reluctant lady. Obviously, each pair is
                characterized by specific appeals and behavioral parameters. In the case of Laura
                and Petrarch the calibration of the parameters is particularly difficult and highly
                subjective: all available information comes from a series of poems. Therefore the
                values given to the parameters in this section do not pretend to be the "correct" ones.
                They are only my personal estimates based on the feelings and impressions I had
                when reading the <em>Canzoniere</em>.
               </p>
            <p>Let us start with the parameters &alpha;<sub>i</sub>, i = 1, 2, 3, that describe the forgetting
            processes. As for &alpha;<sub>i</sub> and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>, there is no doub that</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-alfa.PNG" alt="Parameters alfa">
            </div>
            <p>Indeed, Laura never appears to be strongly involved, while the poet definitely has a
                tenacious attachment. This is described in a number of lyrics, as in sonnet XXXV:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Solo et pensoso i piu deserti campi<br>
                vo mesurando a passi tardi e lenti,<br>
                Ma pur si aspre vie ne' sl selvagge<br>
                cercar non so ch'Amor non venga sempre<br>
                ragionando con meco, et io co llui. <br>
                [Alone and lost in thought, each lonely strand <br>
                I measure out with slow and laggard step,<br>
                Yet I cannot find such harsh and savage trails<br>
                where love does not pursue me as I go,<br>
                with me communing, as with him do I.]
            </blockquote>
            <p>On the other hand,</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-alfas.PNG" alt="Parameters alfa">
            </div>
            <p> since the inspiration of the poet wanes very slowly. Indeed, Petrarch continues to
                write (over one hundred poems) for more than ten years after the death of Laura.
                The main theme of these lyrics is not his passion for Laura, which has long since
                faded, but the memory for her and the invocation of death. This is clear, for example,
                in song CCLXVIII, written about two years after her demise, when he says</p>
            <blockquote>
                ...<br>
                Tempo e ben di morire,<br>
                et o tardato piu ch'i non vorrei.<br>
                Madonna e morta, et a seco il mio core;<br>
                e volendol seguire,<br>
                interromper conven quest'anni rei,<br>
                perche mai veder lei<br>
                di qua non spero, et l'aspettar m'e noia.<br>
                [...<br>
                It's time indeed to die<br>
                and I have lingered more than I desire.<br>
                My lady's dead, and with her my heart lies;<br>
                and, keen with her to fly,<br>
                I now would from this wicked world retire,<br>
                since I can no more aspire<br>
                on earth to see her, and delay will me destroy.]
            </blockquote>
            <p>Consistently, we will constrain the forgetting coefficients ali to satisfy the relationships</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-9.PNG" alt="Equation 9">
            </div>
            <p>For example, the triplet</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/Parameters alfa.PNG" alt="Parameters alfa">
            </div>
            <p> satisfies (9) and can be interpreted by imagining that Laura forgets Petrarch in about
                four months and that Petrarch's passion fades in one year, whereas he remains inspired
                for ten years.</p>
            <p>As far as the reaction parameters &beta;<sub>i</sub> are concerned, again Laura is assumed to be
                    much less sensitive than Petrarch, i.e.,</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/Parameters-beta.PNG" alt="Parameters beta">
            </div>
            <p>This is equivalent to saying that her time of reaction 1/f&beta;<sub>i</sub> equals the forgetting time
                of Petrarch, who is five times more reactive than her to love and appeal.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we assume that</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-11.PNG" alt="Equation 11">
            </div>
            <p> since this is always possible by suitably scaling P and Z</p>
            <p> Finally, opposite signs are given to the appeals of Laura and Petrarch (see Fig. 2),
                namely,</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-12.PNG" alt="Equation 12">
            </div>
            <p>Indeed, as repeatedly described in the Canzoniere, she is a beautiful and inspiring
                    lady. By contrast, Petrarch is a cold scholar interested in history and letters. He is
                    appointed <em>"cappellanus continuus commensalis"</em> by Cardinal Giovanni Colonna, and
                    this ecclesiastic appointment brings him frequently to Avignon, where Laura lives.
                    The negativity of the appeal of Petrarch is somehow recognized by the poet himself,
                    who, in sonnet XLV, while talking about Laura's mirror, says</p>
            <blockquote>
                Il mio adversario in cui veder solete <br>
                gli occhi vostri ch'Amore e '1 ciel honora, <br>
                [My rival in whose depths you're wont to see <br>
                your own dear eyes which Love and heaven apprize,]
            </blockquote>
            <p> Once Petrarch's forgetting coefficient ac2 is fixed, (9)-(12) produce one complete
                parameter setting. A broad estimate for a2 is a2 - 1, corresponding to a time
                constant for Petrarch's love of one year and to the following parameter setting:</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/eq-13.PNG" alt="Equation 13">
            </div>
            <p>Equations (6)-(8) with the parameter values (13) can be numerically integrated for a
                period of 21 years, starting on the day (April 6, 1327) when Laura and Petrarch met
                for the first time and ending on the day she died (April 6, 1348). The selected initial
                conditions are</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/initial-conditions.PNG" alt="Initial conditions">
            </div>
            <p> The first two are obvious, but also the third is plausible since Pet any relevant lyric 
                before 1327. The results of the numerical integration (shown in
                Fig. 3) are qualitatively in full agreement with the Canzoniere and with the analysis
                of Frederic Jones. After a first high peak, Petrarch's love tends toward a regular
                cycle characterized by alternate positive and negative peaks. Also, L(t) and Z(t)
                tend towards a cyclic pattern. At the beginning, Petrarch's inspiration rises much
                more slowly than his love and then remains positive during the entire period. This
                might explain why Petrarch writes his first poem more than three years after he has
                met her, but then continues to produce lyrics without any significant interruption.
                By contrast, Laura's love is always negative. This is in perfect agreement with the
                Canzoniere, where Laura is repeatedly described as adverse. For example, in sonnet
                XXI, the poet calls her "dolce mia guerrera" [my sweet enemy], while in sonnet XLIV
                he says</p>
            <blockquote>
                ne lagrima pero discese anchora <br>
                da' be' vostr'occhi, ma disdegno et ira. <br>
                [and still no tears your lovely eyes assail, <br>
                nothing as yet, but anger and disdai
            </blockquote>
            <p>A comparison of Fig. 1 with Fig. 3 shows that the period of the simulated cycle is
                slightly longer (about 20%) than that identified by Jones. I have therefore increased 
                &alpha;<sub>2</sub> by 20% and repeated the simulation for the new parameter setting:</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/Petrarch Love P.PNG" alt="Petrarch Love P">
                <img src="assets/images/Love P.PNG" alt="Love P">
            </div>
            <p>Because of (9)-(12) the new solution can be simply obtained by stretching the old
                one in time by 20%. The new time pattern for Petrarch's love is shown in Fig. 4
                together with the grades given by Jones to the 23 dated poems (see Fig. 1); obviously,
                I have assumed that the grade is proportional to Petrarch's love. The fit is very
                good-actually, as good as that which is usually obtained when calibrating models
                of electrical and mechanical systems. Moreover, the fit could be further improved by
                slightly modifying the parameter values. But I do not show results along this line,
                because I do not want to give the impression that I believe that Petrarch had been  
                producing his lyrics like a rigid, deterministic machine. Nevertheless, we can conclude
                that the L-P model with the parameter setting (14) strongly supports Frederic Jones's
                conjecture.</p>
            <p> In order to complete the analysis, I have tested the robustness of the L-P cycle
                with respect to perturbations of the parameters. For this, the package LOCBIF, a
                professional software package for the analysis of the bifurcations of continuous-time
                dynamical systems, has been used. The software is based on a continuation technique
                described in Khibnik et al. [5]. By varying only one parameter at a time (except  and 8) with respect to the reference values indicated in (14), I have found that the
                cycle eventually disappears through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This means that
                when the parameters are varied, the L-P cycle can shrink and finally be replaced by
                a stable equilibrium point. The percentage variations of the parameters giving rise to
                this Hopf bifurcation are the following:</p>
            <div class="hero">
                <img src="assets/images/Reference-valor.PNG" alt="Reference valor">
            </div>
            <p> The most critical parameters are &alpha;<sub>2</sub>, &beta;<sub>1</sub>, and &beta;<sub>2</sub>, but we need to vary them quite
                consistently to transform the cyclical regime into a stationary one. This proves,
                numerically, that the L-P cycle we have identified is not due to a perverse combination
                of the parameters, but is, on the contrary, quite robust.</p>
            <p> Finally, I have also tested the robustness of the cycle with respect to functional
                perturbations. For this, I have simulated the system obtained by slightly modify-
                ing the reaction functions of Laura and Petrarch (see (4) and (5)). In particular, I
                have checked that the L-P cycle does not disappear if the reaction functions are not
                symmetric (this is obvious for perturbations of Petrarch's reaction function (4), since
                Laura's love is always negative on the L-P cycle (see Fig. 3)).</p>
