            <h2 id="introduction">Abstract</h2>
            <p> Three ordinary differential equations are proposed to model the dynamics of love
                between Petrarch, a celebrated Italian poet of the 14th century, and Laura, a beautiful but married
                lady. The equations are nonlinear but can be studied through the singular perturbation approach if
                the inspiration of the poet is assumed to have very slow dynamics. In such a case, explicit conditions
                are found in the appeals of Laura and Petrarch and in their behavioral parameters that guarantee the
                existence of a globally stable slow-fast limit cycle. These conditions are consistent with the relatively
                clear portrait of the two personalities one gets while reading the poems addressed to Laura. On the
                basis of the scarce and only qualitative information available, the calibration of the parameters is
                also performed; the result is that the calibrated model shows that the poet's emotions followed for
                about 20 years a quite regular cyclical pattern ranging from the extremes of ecstasy to despair. All
                these findings agree with the recent results of Frederic Jones, who, through a detailed stylistic and
                linguistic analysis of the poems inspired by Laura, has discovered Petrarch's emotional cycle in a
                fully independent way.</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Since differential calculus was introduced by Newton, dy-
                    namic phenomena in physics, biology, economics, and all other sciences have been
                    extensively studied with differential equations. Surprisingly, one of the most impor-
                    tant problems concerning our lives, the dynamics of love, has not yet been tackled
                    in this way, the only exception being a contribution by Strogatz [1] who reports (in
                    a one-page paper entitled "Love Affairs and Differential Equations") his success in
                    teaching harmonic oscillators by making reference to Romeo and Juliet (see also [2],
                    [3]).</p>
                <p>This paper is devoted to the presentation and analysis of a model based on differ-
                    ential equations that pretend to describe the dynamics of love between two persons
                    by accounting for their personalities. The model makes specific reference to a very
                    special and famous case of unrequited love.</p>
                <p> The study has been stimulated by a recent work by Frederic Jones [4] on Petrarch's
                    <em>Canzoniere</em>, the most celebrated book of love poems in the Western world. A detailed
                    linguistic and stylistic analysis of all the dated poems addressed by Petrarch to his
                    platonic mistress Laura has allowed Jones to conjecture that the poet's emotions
                    follow for approximately 20 years a quite regular cyclical pattern, ranging from the
                    extremes of ecstasy to despair. On the basis of this conjecture, Jones was able to
                    put all undated poems in chronological order, and then show that Petrarch's lyrical
                    style had evolved from early medieval symbolic practices to modern humanistic and
                    artistic modes of thought and expression</p>
                <p>The analysis presented in this paper is fully independent of that carried out by
                    Jones, but strongly supports his findings. In fact, for suitable values of Laura's and
                    Petrarch's behavioral parameters, the model has a unique attractor which is, indeed,
                    a limit cycle. The conditions required for the existence of such a limit cycle are
                    easily interpretable and agree with the relatively clear portrait of the two personalities
                    emerging from the <em>Canzoniere</em>.</p>
                <p>These conditions are derived by decomposing the system into fast (Laura and
                    Petrarch's love) and slow (Petrarch's poetic inspiration) components. The analysis
                    shows that small variations of poetic inspiration can induce catastrophic transitions
                    of the fast components. These findings provide extra support to the work of Jones
                    who, on a purely intuitive basis, has advocated catastrophe theory to support his
                    methodology of investigation.</p>
